# AI-Health-Assitant
# Project Overview
The AI Health Assistant is a simple Python-based 
application that provides basic health awareness
to users by analysing their symptoms and daily habits.
The system does not replace a doctor, it only helps 
user understand their health condition at a basic level
and guides them with simple suggestions.

It takes input like:

~Age

~Sleep

~Water intake

~Common symptoms (fever, cough, headache, tiredness)

Based on the answers, the system calculates a health risk level 
and displays friendly recommendations.
