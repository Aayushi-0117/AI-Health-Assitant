# Problem Statement
In today’s lifestyle, many people ignore their health due to busy schedules, lack of awareness, or fear of visiting a doctor for small issues. People often search for health information on the internet, which can be confusing, misleading, or overwhelming. This can cause unnecessary panic or, in some cases, unhealthy delays in seeking medical help.

There is a need for a simple, easy-to-use and accessible system that can provide basic health awareness and early guidance based on a person’s common symptoms and daily habits.

The AI Health Assistant is developed to solve this problem by taking simple user inputs such as age, sleep hours, water intake and common symptoms, then analysing them to provide a basic health status and suggestions.

This system is not meant to replace a doctor, but to help users become more aware of their health and take timely action when needed.

# Scope of the Project

The scope of this project includes:

~Taking basic health inputs from the user

This project can be further extended in the future to include:

~A chatbot interface

~A mobile or web application

# Target Users
The target users of this system are:

~Students who want quick health awareness
